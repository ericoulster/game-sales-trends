# game-sales-trends
An analysis I did last year about videogame sales. This was just for fun, and used a dataset obtained from Kaggle.

The primary analysis itself is contained within 'VGsales write-up.docx'. The rest is just provided for posterity & confirming my analyses.

A formatted write-up is also available on my website:
